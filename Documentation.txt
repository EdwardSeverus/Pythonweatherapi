Python Weather API Documentation

This Python module provides a simple and straightforward way to retrieve weather data for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API. 

The module utilizes the requests library for making HTTP requests and includes proper error handling to ensure reliable data retrieval and handling of potential errors during the API request.


** Make sure to replace "your_api_key" with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap **



Function Details

get_weather(city, api_key)

This function retrieves weather data for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Parameterscity (str): The name of the city for which to retrieve weather data.api_key (str): Your API key from OpenWeatherMap.

Returnsdict or None: The weather data as a dictionary if retrieval is successful, None otherwise.

Exceptionsrequests.exceptions.HTTPError: Raised if the API request returns an HTTP error status code.

requests.exceptions.RequestException: Raised for other request-related errors.

NotesThe function retrieves weather data in metric units by default.

You can modify it to retrieve data in imperial units by changing the "units" parameter to "imperial".

Error handling is implemented to catch and handle potential exceptions during the API request. 

If an error occurs, appropriate error messages are displayed.

The API response data is returned as a dictionary, allowing you to access specific weather information such as temperature, humidity, etc., for further processing.

That concludes the documentation for the Python weather API module that uses the requests library. 
Use this module to easily retrieve weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API with proper authentication and error handling.
